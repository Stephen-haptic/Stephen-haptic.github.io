    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Stephen Gantt is an aspiring game designer with several years of programming 
experience under his belt as well as plenty of game design experience in the form of 
personal projects and game jam participation, being the primary developer of 
Unclaimed Quest for the 2025 Inbound Shovel game jam. In addition to his 
experience with programming and game engines, Stephen has worked with 3D 
modeling and texturing software, as well as having worked with soundtrack 
composers and foley artists, giving him a deeper understanding and appreciation of 
the entire game design process. 
    When not working on the software side of things Stephen enjoys running 
sessions of D&D for his friends and family, exploring narratives through game 
mechanics and tweaking those mechanics where necessary.
